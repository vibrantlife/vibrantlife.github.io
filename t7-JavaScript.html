      <h2>For Loop - Ruby vs Javascript</h2>
      <h3>Nichole Shelton</h3>
      <h3>December 16, 2014</h3>

      <p>
        Learning Ruby was an uphill battle for me. When we started JavaScript, I realized how much I learned from Ruby and that gave me a pretty big boost in confidence. Some things are the same (which is so sweet!) and some things are different. For this blog post, we'll take a look at the for loop in both Ruby and Javascript.
      </p>

      <p>First, let's review the term loop and iteration. Iteration is essentially going through a group of items (like an array) and doing something to each item in the group. For the examples below we'll iterate through an array of numbers using a for loop and tell the program "print each item in the array please!".</p>

      <h2>Ruby - For Loop</h2>
      <p>Dearest Ruby of COURSE has multiple ways to execute a for loop. Below, we'll take a look at 2 of the most common ways. </p>

      <p class="code">
        array = [1, 2, 3, 4]<br>
          for num in array<br>
            puts num #print each num on its own line<br>
          end<br>
<br>
        output:<br>
        1<br>
        2<br>
        3<br>
        4<br>
        => [1, 2, 3, 4]
      </p>

      <p>Easy right. Now let's look at how to do this with the .each method.</p>

      <p class="code">
        array = [1, 2, 3, 4]<br>
          array.each do |num|<br>
            puts num<br>
          end<br>
<br>
          output:<br>
          1<br>
          2<br>
          3<br>
          4<br>
          => [1, 2, 3, 4]
      </p>

      <p>Same output. Now let's look at JavaScript. Although there is a way to use the each method, I'm going to show the most common way to do this in JavaScript. </p>

      <p class="code">
        var array = [1,2,3,4]; <br>
        for (var i = 0; i < value; i++) {<br>
          console.log(array[i]);<br>
      };<br>
<br>
      output:<br>
       1<br>
       2<br>
       3<br>
       4<br>
       undefined

      </p>

      <p>What similarities did you notice? This is what I noticed:</p>
      <p class="code">
        <li>Defined array</li>
        <li>Used for loop</li>
        <li>Used a print statement</li>
      </p>

        <p>What differences did you find? Here's my list:</p>
        <p class="code">
         <li>In JavaScript, when you are printing the result, you need to refer to the variable in the for loop.</li>
         <li> In Ruby, there's more than one way to accomplish the code (of course!)</li>
         <li>In JavaScript, you must set a variable starting point, indicate that the variable is less than the value, then tell it how much to increment by.</li>
         <li> In JavaScript, you need to make sure you open and close your curly braces and use semicolons to end statements.</li>
