      <h2>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h2>
      <h3>Nichole Shelton</h3>
      <h3>December 16, 2014</h3>

      <p>
      I chose the following values to discusss for this blog post: independence, free time, meaningful work, and persistence. On a scale of 1(disagree) to 5(agree) I try to live up to these values in the following order:
      </p>

      <p class="code">
        <ul>Independence       5</ul>
        <ul>Free Time          5</ul>
        <ul>Meaningful Work    5</ul>
        <ul>Persistence        4</ul>
      </p>

      <p>Meaningful work is very important to me because we spend so much of our lives as Americans at work, I want to make sure what I'm doing have some value to humanity. I care very much about social justice and enriching communities, it's important for my work to give back in some way too. </p>

      <p>My best friend asked for advice on healthy eating. I'm a bit of a health nut, I'm pretty careful about what I eat, I fiercely read labels and even go make sure I know where my food comes from. She asked about my gluten free diets and different substititions that I use for pasta and bread.   </p>

      <p>I strongly identify with the values I selected. Persistence and free time will help me deal with stereotype threat. Taking breaks and having some time to myself will help me recharge when I'm feeling blue. I really like practicing yoga and feeling the accomplishments in my body each day. I will use that to destress and refocus. I'm looking forward to being on campus soon! </p>
