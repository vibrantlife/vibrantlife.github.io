      <h2>Asking good questions to get good answers</h2>

      <p>
        There is an art to asking good questions. Asking good questions is something I've had to learn and improve on in my professional history. I am pretty straight forward and tend to ask "closed" questions which lead to yes/no answers. When asking questions, it's best to be verbose, give some context, and try to be as thoroguh as possible. I used to get frustrated by the amount of time it takes to ask the question to get the answer I'm looking for (why can't anyone read my mind!), but now I realize the value of asking good questions. It helps me to really articulate what my problems are and what I need help with, and it helps the person who is spending time with me to get me to where I need to be faster. <br>

        In my opinion, there are 3 main characteristics that make up a good question:
        <ul>
          <li>Concise and to the point. You don't want to be too long winded</li>
          <li>Providing context for your problem. If someone can understand your thinking process, it can help them to identify where you are getting stuck or another aspect of the problem you didn't realize you were grappling with. </li>
          <li>Being open to the answers. Listening and being ready to receive the feedback from the question is just as important as being able to ask a good quesiton. </li>
        </ul><br>
        I vow to remember this blog post for my time during DBC. I know I'll need it.
