      <h2>Concrete Sequential with a little Rando Mixed In</h2>

      So, I retook the <a href ="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html"> personal thinking style </a> quiz to refresh my memory and I think it's pretty accurate. I ended up definitely concrete and a toss up between sequential and random. I display characteristics for boht concrete sequetial and concrete random. According to the <a href ="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm"> Gregoric Thinking Style </a> my preceptual quality is concerte: I register information directly through my 5 senses. I don't look for hidden meanings. Basically, I keep it real. My ordering ability is both sequential and random. How on earth is that even possible? Apparently, both qualities are present in each person, but one pattern is persistent. If I had to choose one I think it would be sequential, but I also identify with random. Very random of me, right? People with sequential ordering ability organize information linearly. These people like to have a plan. I used to be an event planner so this holds very true for me. People with random ordering ability organize information in chunks and not in order, but these people still produce the desired result. When I'm reading directions I hardly ever follow directions in order. I always skip steps and provide a result that's unique to me. I am not a good baker, because I can't stand following recipes to a T.

      <p> So far at DBC I've struggled the most with the instructions to complete challenges. If the instructions aren't explicit I find myself getting frustrated if it takes me a long time to figure out the answer. Writing this blog is definitely helping me to remember that this is a character trait of mine that I need to be more mindful of. I started implementing handstand drills when I get frustrated to channel the energy into something more positive. Then I come back with a fresh perspective and continue grappling with the problem.

      <p>I came into DBC knowing that I often times display a fixed mindset. Attending DBC for this short time has helped me to live in a growth mindset type of thinking every day. The constant challenges and obstacles have already impacted my life in more ways than I realized. One of the best things that has happened has been learning from the squirrel community and being inspired by others and not feeling competetive, but feeling a sense of community and support.
