        <h4>Musings on the Benefits of Git and GitHub</h4>

            The benefits of version control are numerous, but as a newb I can easily identify 2 benefits.</p>
            1. History - You can go back in time to view older versions of your code. If I were to break the code, I'd simply need to go to a previous version when the code was working and begin from there.<br>
            2. Collaboration - Without version control working on a group project could be complete anarchy. Version control on GitHub allows you to work with others, share your changes and give feedback before commiting the code.

          <p>Git helps to keep track of changes by showing a history of the changes. You can view all of the changes in any repo by entering <b>git log</b>into your terminal.</p>

          <p>GitHub is a great place to store code. For one, it's easily accessible. All you need is an internet connection. Additionally, you have access to a large community to collaborate with and seek feedback from. Last, it's free!</p>
      </ol>
