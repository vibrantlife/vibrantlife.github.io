Blog 2: Opinions on the DBC Experience

October 31, 2014 - All Hallow's Eve

Coming from a strong academic background I find the DBC experience very refreshing. I've found traditional educational institutions to be stuffy and inflexible. I like the idea of taking ownership of my education. I se myself engaging wholeheartedly albeit somewhat reserved. I am often slow to warm to others, but that doesn't mean I'm not engaged in the experience. I like observing and taking in the environment. My expectations for the learning environment have not changed, however I'm eager to get there in person and experience the rush. I am definitely nervous particularly because of the engineering empathy piece. It can be challenging to be a minority and sharing intimate pieces of yourself with complete strangers. I look forward to the challenge, for creating new opportunities for me to learn, grow, and reflect.
