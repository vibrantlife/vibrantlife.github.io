First Blog: Musings on the Benefits of Git and GitHub

October 31, 2014 - All Hallows' Eve

The benefits of version control are numerous, but as a newb I can easily identify 2 benefits.
  1. History - You can go back in time to view older versions of your code. If I were to break the code, I'd simply need to go to a previous version when the code was working and begin from there.
  2. Collaboration - Without version control working on a group project could be complete anarchy. Version control on GitHub allows you to work with others, share your changes and give feedback before commiting the code.

Git helps to keep track of changes by showing a history of the changes. You can view all of the changes in any repo by entering **git log** into your terminal.

GitHub is a great place to store code. For one, it's easily accessible. All you need is an internet connection. Additionally, you have access to a large community to collaborate with and seek feedback from. Last, it's free!
