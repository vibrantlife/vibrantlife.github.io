      Well, unfortunatley for me the holidays are a source of great anguish and heartache. My family does not get along during the holidays and it's not a fun time for me. I typically try to spend the least amount of time as possible at home during the holidays. This Christmas was exactly the same. Had me singing <br>

       It all started with an email. My mom LOVES to send me emails to tell me what a horrible human I am. She doens't use technology for good. She emailed me to tell me I wasn't being a good housewife to my boyfriend 4 days before Christmas. Lovely present right? At first, I was PISSED. My inner feminist wanted to tell her that I'm no 1950s housewife and I am studying like mad (she thinks I'm just "playing" on the computer) and we share household duties in the home. I started to write her a nasty email back and tell her all about herself, but I didn't. I ignored her phone calls for a few days and spent some time really thinking about her email and how I wanted to respond. Eventually, I responded. I told her that I showed the email to my boyfriend and he didn't feel like anything she said was true and his opinion is the only one that matters on this topic. I was a tad snarky though, I told her instead of judging my life, she should take a good hard look in the mirror. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. <br>
       <br>
       I don't think I would do anything differently. It is what it is. She's my mom so I gotta love her right? I've decided not to let her toxicity into my life and I told her that over the holidays. When she's being a negative nelly I can't be a part of it. It distracts me from my goals and makes me unhappy and that's not the life I want to lead. I've decided not to read any emails from my mom anymore. <br>
       <br>
       I learned you can't choose your family! LOL and you can't ignore issues and things that are sensitive are better said in person. Nobody likes to get nasty emails. It sucks.
