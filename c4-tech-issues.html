      <h2>Social Responsibility in the Bustling Tech Community</h2>
      <p>Nichole Shelton</p>
      <p>November 23, 2014</p>

      <h3>My Love Letter to Oakland</h3>
      <p>I'm resident of the planet of <a href="http://matadornetwork.com/life/18-reasons-everyone-cool-creative-moving-oakland/">Oakland</a>. As each year passes, I find myself falling more deeply in love with this city. The people, the art, the weather (350 days of sunshine a year), and the food make this by far the most beautiful city I've ever lived in (I've lived in about a dozen and visited about a dozen countries). As a resident for the last 6 years, I've witnessed tremendous growth and change in the city. Although I am from a city far away, I call Oakland my home and I take social responsibility in my home seriously. I volunteer monthly at a local <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ebaldc/sets/72157644992805314/">community garden</a> and I stay up on politics for my neighborhood. I do this, not just because I love my city, but because I believe in giving back to the land that's given so much to me. I  wish the numerous tech companies in the bay area, that usilize so many resources in the bay area felt the same way. </p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>The bay area is the fertile crescent of all things tech. There are multibillion dollar corporations that call the bay area home, yet they rarely use their super powers to solve problems locally. Facebook, Apple, and Samsung (to name a few) are notorious for their lack of social responsibility and engagement in their local communities. The lack of civic engagement by these companies is in my opinion, treacherous. Communities like Oakland are suffering because of direct action from these tech giants. Their private shuttles alone have caused gentrification in numerous neighborhoods both in Oakland and San Francisco. According to a recent study, rent near these private shuttle stops have raised 20% over the course of a year. This is driving out long time residents and making <a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/flagwars/special_gentrification.php">gentrification</a> a visible issue.</p>

      <h3>When Life Gives You Lemons</h3>
      <p>Slice them up and take a shot of Tequila! So what do we do? How do we solve this problem? Personally, I plan to work for companies that intend to make philanthropy a priority. Mark Benioff at Salesforce Fourndation is KILLING.IT. <a href="http://www.salesforcefoundation.org/about-us/sharethemodel/">The Salesforce Foundation</a> has donated more than $70 million dollars in grants and their employees are allowed to spend 1% of their time volunteering. If I choose to work at an organization that doesn't have philanthropy as one of its pillars in its mission statement, I intend to make the suggestion to the company. All it takes is one person to start a movement. Will you join me? <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement?language=en">How to start a movement</a></p>
