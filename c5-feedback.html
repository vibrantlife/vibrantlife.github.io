      <h2>Pairing is Caring</h2>

        <h2>Pairing</h2>
          <p>Personally, I love pairing. Before I actively started reaching out to pair with others I felt so isolated and I didn't realize that others were struggling with the same concepts I was. During pairing sessions it's very beneficial to me to see how others are approaching the problems. I learn a lot from those interactions. It's really nice to get to know others and hear their stories. It's difficult for me to pair because I always feel like the weaker person. I know that I am and I'm still learning, but it is such a blow to my silly little ego. Obviously, I need to get that in check. </p>

          <h2>Feedback</h2>
          <p>Overall, I felt great when I read my feedback. It is always so kind and affirming. Love the squirrel fam! The feedback recently has been very helpful. I plan to do more preparations before my pairing sessions and take breaks before my sessions when possible so that I'm refreshed and able to dedicate 100% to the session. Because of my schedule, I often have to pack a lot into one day and unfortunately my pairs can be a little lackluster after a 14 hour day. What is most difficult about writing feedback is giving constructive feedback to those who I feel are more advanced than I am. Overall, I love pairing and I think the feedback will be very beneficial as we move forward and are learning more challenging concepts. </p>
