      <h2>Keepin it Classy</h2>

      <p>
      Currently I'm pretty obsessed with yoga. I definitely need it to help me get through DBC! Right now I'm working on the coveted headstand. Believe, once I achieve it, I'll be doing a little of this:<br>
      <img src="imgs/handstand.gif" alt="Handstand Gif" style="width:40%;height:300px">
      </p>

       <p>I like to infuse my coding sessions with a little yoga. Let's see if I can achieve that in this blog post. We're going to discuss </p>

       <h2>What is a class? </h2>
       <p>A class is an object. According to the Well Grounded Rubyist "a class let's your group behaviors (methods) into convenient bundles, so that you can quickly create many objects that behave essentially the same way." In other words, classes are a way to objects and methods. Below, I'm going to create a class <highlight>Yoga</highlight>. Classes have to appear in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase">CamelCase</a>.</p>

       <p class="code">
        class Yoga
          def method_name
          end
        end
       </p>

       <p>Pretty simple. Now we'll need to initialize our <highlight>instance variables</hightlight>.</p>

       <h2>What's an instance variable?</h2>
       <p><highlight>Instance variables</highlight> are pretty cool. They are variables that you create and are accessible throughout the entire life of the class (to the class end statement). You can recognize the instance variables by the <highlight>@</highlight> sign in front of them. Let's add two instance variables to our <highlight>Yoga class</highlight>. I want to add the type of yoga and the favorite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana">asana</a>. In order to do this you must define a method "initialize". This will store the instance variables and allow the programmer to access them through the life of the class.</p>

       <p class="code">
        class Yoga
          def initialize(type, asana)
            @type = type
            @fav_asana = fav_asana
          end
        end
       </p>

       <p>Very good. We're getting somewhere. Now let's add a few methods and see how this little program will work.</p>

       <p class="code">
        class Yoga
          def initialize(name, type, asana)
            @name = name
            @type = type
            @asana = asana
          end

          def name
            @name
          end

          def type
            @type
          end

          def fav_asana
            @asana
          end

          def add_them_together
              return "#{@name}'s favorite type of yoga is #{@type} and she loves to practice the #{@asana}."
          end
        end
  </p>
  <p>When we call the class we need to define a new variable (be descriptive) and call the class using <highlight>the class name + .new</highlight> Check it.</p>
  <p class="code">
my_yoga = Yoga.new("Nichole", "Ashtanga", "Shirshasana - headstand")
puts my_yoga.fav_asana
       </p>

       <p>And our output is the following:</p>

       <p class="code">
          Nichole's favorite type of yoga is Ashtanga and she loves to practice the Shirshasana - headstand.
       </p>

<p>We've learned so much, but that's not all! This week, we learned about these nifty syntatic sugary methods. I love the saying <highlight>DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself</highlight>. Attributes allow you to shorten your code. Notice the methods above where we simply defined the method and set it to the instance variable. Look at the 3 methods above (type, name, fav_asana)...Go ahead scroll up... I"ll wait.  So we can get rid of alllll of that code. How might you ask? Getter and setter attributes. I could probably do a blog post on just them so I'm going to just leave a little link for you here to read up on them: <a href="http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/4-ruby-primer-ascent/chapters/45-more-classes/lessons/110-instance-variables">Getter and Setter Attributes.</a> Did ya read it? Awesome. Let's take a look at how these attributes help us to consolidate our code. I'm just going to use the <highlight>attr_reader</highlight> method here.</p>

<p class="code">
class Yoga
  attr_reader :name, :type, :asana
  def initialize(name, type, asana)
    @name = name
    @type = type
    @asana = asana
  end

  def add_them_together
    return "#{@name}'s favorite type of yoga is #{@type} and she loves to practice the #{@asana}."
  end
end

my_yoga = Yoga.new("Nichole", "Ashtanga", "Shirshasana - headstand")
puts my_yoga.add_them_together<br>

<br>
OUTPUT<br>

Nichole's favorite type of yoga is Ashtanga and she loves to practice the Shirshasana - headstand.

</p>

<p>The output was the same! Hope this was helpful. I know it certainly helped me to learn by writing it out. </p>
