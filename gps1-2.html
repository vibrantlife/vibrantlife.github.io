            <h3>What is Pair Programming</h3>
            <p>Pair programming is a structured way to tackle a problem and learn from each other.</p>

            <h3>Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h3>
            <p>Pair programming is important to DBC because it allows students to learn from one another, learn through teaching, and learn different perspectives from their peers.</p>

            <h3>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
            <p>When someone is the driver they are doing the actual programming and action on the computer. The navigator guides and does the necessary research for the driver.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Overall we really like working in pairs. It gives us the opportunity to learn from another person and to share the workload. We had a good pairing session that was productive and positive. OUr guide was helpful and dropped knowledge on us throughout the session.</p>
