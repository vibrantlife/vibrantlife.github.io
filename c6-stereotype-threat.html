      <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
      <h3>Nichole Shelton</h3>
      <h3>December 7, 2014</h3>

      <p>
        According to <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">ReducingStereoTypeThreat.org</a> "Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group    (Steele & Aronson, 1995)." <br>
        <br>
        At times during phase 0, I've struggled with stereotype threat. The thought that "women aren't good programmers" has floated around in my head during challenges when I was battling with Ruby. I've combatted this by taking a deep breath, giving myself some credit because I'm doing pretty fricking well, and getting back to work. It's important for me to take time outs to keep from getting frustrated. <br>
        <br>
        When giving or receiving meaningful feedback, I will do my best to put my ego aside, insure that the person (or myself) understands feedback is not personal, and be honest and truthful. Honesty is the best policy.
